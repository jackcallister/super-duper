# Super Duper

This is both an experiment to explore React JS and to scratch own itch. Every Sunday I struggle to come up with a supermarket list of meals. Super Duper is very small single page application to solve this problem. 

# How use

Simply create a bunch of your favourite meals, with ingredients then when shopping day rolls around pick your meals for the week and a shopping list will automatically be compiled for you. Either print it off, write it down or email it to yourself. Super.

Currently I havn't implemented any designs but I'm getting there :)
