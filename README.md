# Super Duper

This is both an experiment to explore React JS and an attemt to scratch my own itch. Every Sunday I struggle to come up with a supermarket list of meals. Super Duper is very small single page application to solve this problem. 

# How use

Simply create a bunch of your favorite meals, with ingredients then when shopping day rolls around pick your meals for the week and a shopping list will automatically be compiled for you. Either print it off, write it down or email it to yourself. Super.

Currently I've not done any design work but all the functionality is there :)
